# Quiz Me

This project was created in Visual Basic Editor to randomize questions origination from a question bank Table, allowing users to answer by selecting the correct option (e.g. A, B, C, D, True, or False). Quiz Me allows the user to traverse back and forth during the quiz, intelligently retrieving answers to previous questions, allowing changes to be made and saved. At the end of a quiz, SQL is used to iterate over the user's answer sheet and grade for accuracy, finally generating a report card that displays missed questions and their respective correct answers.

## Usage

Quiz Me is the code behind a Microsoft Access database that contains custom Tables, Forms, and Reports. In order to use this code, you must first construct this database in Access, then paste this code in Visual Basic Editor. When building your queries, simply copy and paste the SQL statements contained in this repository for best results. A firm understanding of Microsoft Access, Visual Basic, and SQL is recommended.
